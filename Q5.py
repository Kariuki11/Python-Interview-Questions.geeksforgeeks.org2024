5. What is the difference between a Mutable datatype and an Immutable data type?

            # Mutable data types can be edited i.e., they can change at runtime. Eg – List, Dictionary, etc.
            # Immutable data types can not be edited i.e., they can not change at runtime. Eg – String, Tuple, etc.
