15. Can we Pass a function as an argument in Python?

               # Yes, Several arguments can be passed to a function, including objects, variables (of the same or distinct data types), and functions.
               # Functions can be passed as parameters to other functions because they are objects. Higher-order functions are functions that can take other functions as arguments.
