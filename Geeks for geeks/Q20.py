20. What is a dynamically typed language?
#Typed languages are the languages in which we define the type of data type and it will be known by the machine at the compile-time or at runtime. Typed languages can be classified into two categories:

        #Statically typed languages: In this type of language, the data type of a variable is known at the compile time which means the programmer has to specify the data type of a variable at the time of its declaration. 
        #Dynamically typed languages: These are the languages that do not require any pre-defined data type for any variable as it is interpreted at runtime by the machine itself. In these languages, interpreters assign the data type to a variable at runtime depending on its value.
