14. Difference between for loop and while loop in Python

            #The “for” Loop is generally used to iterate through the elements of various collection types such as List, Tuple, Set, and Dictionary. Developers use a “for” loop where they have both the conditions start and the end. Whereas, the “while” loop is the actual looping feature that is used in any other programming language. Programmers use a Python while loop where they just have the end conditions.
